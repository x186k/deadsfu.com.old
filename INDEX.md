### - Remarkably Easy

We want DeadSFU to be super easy to use. We've gone great lengths to achieve this.

### - Massively Scalable

DeadSFU has been designed from the ground-up to be multi-server scalable, and for implementation to also be as easy as possible.

### - Broadcasting Ready

Real-time audio, video broadcasting is a sweet-spot for DeadSFU. You can create multi-server broadcasting systems with a few Docker instances. Auto-scaling systems are possible too.

### - Cloud Native

We encourage using DeadSFU with Docker, because itâ€™s a great way to build multi-server systems. Of course you can use binaries or build from source if you prefer.

### - No Coding Necessary

An HTTP server and a simple HTML/JS broadcast and watch application is built in. You can turn this off if you decide to use your own HTML/JS.

### - Simulcast and Multi-track Switching

DeadSFU supports hundreds video input tracks and a single audio track on publisher ingress. Subscribers can receive a single video track and ask the SFU to switch between sources, or subscribers can receive the full bundle of audio and video tracks.
